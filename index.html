            <p>However, since girls sets higher genetic mutations, it is probably in their severe stages of the spectrum by the time they are diagnosed with ASD.</p>

Is it true that hispanic children are unlikely to have ASD than their counterparts? In fact, all of the data here are based on ASD surveillance,  which particularly collected in public schools. Therefore, a portion of nonwhite children with ASD are impossible to be identified and evaluated. </p>
