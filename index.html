        <p> Large amounts of money has to paid for caring a child with ASD. But what kinds of economic burden their parents and society have to bear? This illustrates the regression-adjusted differences in non–health care costs for children with ASD compared with children without ASD, by severity and diagnostic subgroups. Study samples are ranging from children ages 3 to 17 years with and without parent-reported ASD.</p>
        <p>(1) Time costs were converted to a dollar value by multiplying the number of hours spent on each caregiving activity by the 2011 mean wage rate for all US workers ($23/hour).</p>
        <p>(2) School represents the special education services that ASD children received from their schools, principally are from public schools</p>
        <p>(3) All kinds of resources that used to look after children with parent-reported ASD such as children care,legal services,and transportation are ascribed to family-corridinated services</p>
